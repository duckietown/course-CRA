## Introduction

During lectures, we explained one direction of the image pipeline:  

<figure>
  <img style="width:30em" src="images/image_pipeline.png"/>
</figure>

In this exercise, we are going to look at the pipeline in the opposite direction.

It is often said that:

> "The inverse of computer vision is computer graphics."  

The inverse pipeline looks like this:  

<figure>
  <img style="width:30em" src="images/graphics.png"/>
</figure>  

In simple words, instead of extracting information from our camera, we want to introduce some data in the imagery.

For this exercise concept like homographies, projection matrices, camera and world coordinates are essential so be sure to have those in mind while you try to solve the exercises in the next sections.
