  Requires: [Odometry with Wheel Encoders](+duckietown-robotics-development#odometry-modeling)

  Requires: [Modeling the Duckiebot and Representations](+duckietown-robotics-development#representations-modeling)

  Requires: [Advanced Augmented Reality Exercise](#cra-apriltag-augmented-reality-exercise)

  Results: Understand how to build a TF tree in ROS and visualize it in RViz

  Results: Be able to create a multi-package Dockerized ROS workspace, and deploy it on the Duckiebot

  Results: Create a wheel-encoder based estimator. Understand the benefits and drawbacks of such an estimator.

  Results: Create an Apriltag-based estimator. Understand the benefits and drawbacks of this estimator.

  Results: Create a sensor fusion node that fuses estimates from the above individual estimators
