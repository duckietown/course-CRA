In the last part of this book you have learned how the Duckiebot can localize itself in the lane. 
In this part, you are going to learn how to leverage this knowledge to implement different control algorithms which enable the Duckiebot to keep itself in the lane and you will be introduced to range of details that need to be addressed when controlling a real system.
