# Modeling and control  {#part:cra-modeling status=ready}

In the first two parts of this book you have learned about the image pipeline and how a Duckiebot localizes itself within a lane. Now we want to make use of that knowledge by implementing control algorithms that will keep the Duckiebot in the lane.
In this section you will learn about the basics of control theory and what you have to pay attention to when you work on a robot that operates in the real world.
